The program was divided into 12 weeks of content whose refer from "Table of Content"

### Week 1

{% hint style="info" %}
**1.1 Introduction**

Introduction to fundamental of programming

1. Talking about why we seriously need to learn a programming language
2. Problem solving by Flow Chart diagram
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**1.2 Python Environment Setup**

**Times**: 2 hours

The ultimately step, to play with Python. Without setting thing up no playground to learn.

1. Install Python3.7 on Machine

**1.3 Weekly Exercise**

In this week, students are assigned by instructor, to design and solve problems with flowchat diagram.
{% endhint %}

### Week 2

{% hint style="info" %}
**2.1 Pythonic Data**

**Times**: 1 hours

This lesson we will talk about data type whose play an important role in any programming language.

1. Intro to Data Types in Python \( aka Pythonic Data \)
2. Integer
3. Floating
4. Complex
5. String
6. Bool
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**2.2 Basic Operators**

**Times**: 2 hours

Operations that we're going to learn is not only +, -, \*, and / or we've known in the formal name as 'Arithmetic operator' it's just one of them. In this week, we will expose all these operators to all of you.

1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment operators

4. Logical operators
5. Identity operators
6. Membership operators
7. Bitwise operators
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**2.3 Weekly Exercise**

This week, students will learn how to solve mathematical problems with Python.
{% endhint %}

### Week 3

{% hint style="info" %}
**3.1 Decision Making**

**Times:** 4 hours

Machines doesn't knows how to think by itself programming is the way to make them look smarter. On this week we will learn about how to make a decision making in some tasks by programming a condition then let's pass to machine do for us.

1. IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement
2. Nested IF Statement
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**3.2 Weekly exercise**

This week we focus on making some decision making so, the problem should be more complicated. Student has to mixed older lessons to the new one to solve problems.
{% endhint %}

### Week 4

{% hint style="info" %}
**4.1 Repeatations**

**Times:** 4 hours

You'll learn the powerful concept which make computer machine faster than man. The concept is 'Repeatations' or 'Looping'.

1. Understanding Looping from flowchart
2. For loop syntax in Python
3. While loop and infinite
4. Nested loop
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**4.2 Weekly exercise**

Weekly problems are more difficult and need more computational power to solve problems.

Therefore, all problems was designed to purpose which unsolvable by man.
