# Your First Application

The first application for every programming students is **" Hello, World! "**, to print the word to a monitor display that make us more confident in my opinion. So let's do it!

#### Step 1 Writing a Code

Open your favorite text editor and type the following code

```python
print('Hello, World')
```

#### Step 2 Save file as python extension \( .py \)

Then, save it named as **hello.py**

#### Step 3 Runing time!

Now, go to your lovely terminal \( aka cmd in Windows \) then interpret our python script by

```python
python3 hello.py
```

That's it!  You will got something like this...

```bash
Hello, world!
```

Be proud of yourself you've done the first quest of your journey, but the way is too long. If you ready let's go to next chapter. Good Luck!!
