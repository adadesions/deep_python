  Generally, before you starting to write you new application you have to write
  your idea down on a piece of paper to make everything clearly. Let's see what
  we tool that we will work on it.

# Basic Software Design with Flowchart

## A piece of paper, is the first step to make the world better.

Coding is the last step of software development, Do not rush if your thought doubtful.

I have a story which I want to tell you, The most new programmer their love coding and we know that programmers always try to solve a problem with their code, but not every new can solve in their mind and express it to a code consequently, someone give up and plant in their mind which programming is F\*\*\*ing hard!   


In my opinion, If someone had faced the problem that I told you earler, don't worry I'm a programmer I will fix the bug. One easily step, is just let all the things go and go back to programming fundamental That's it!!

### Flowchart Diagram, a tool whose clearify your idea

The goal is to explain your thought to everyone whos involves  or members in your team. I dare to say that every diagrams in the world were built and developed for some purposes but one importants thing is to communicate to each other to help everyone has the same vision. Now let's see what is a flow chart.

### First things First, You need to know a flow chart

I love the concept of learning new thing from Machine learning approaches and I think it's a right way for human learning as well. Let me show you.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ada's Learning Concept \(ALC\)** 

is to learn from significant sample data by seeing, explaining, and labeling and then go to symbol definitions, terminology, or sophiticate things  
  
**Keys**   
Find significant sample  
Knowing difference in each sample  
Classification and Grouping sample whose help you clearer
{% endhint %}

### Symbols used in flowchart

Back to the 1912, the first flow chart was introduced by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth known as "Flow process chart". Along the time it was developed by pioneers in vary industries espicially, a Computer science in 1940  [Herman Goldstine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Goldstine) and [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) ahd developed a flowchart to plan computer program.

Now 2018, 106 years that we still using this powerful tool to communicate, plan, and explain concept in our head to other. Is it worth enough to learn it? \( if answer is yes, let's take all of your focus on it \)

The symbols was developed by many people, many companise, and many fields so don't worry if you found some symbols definition is differ from what you've known.

### Significant samples

**Simple Flowchart**

1. **Find some lost thing flowchart** Clear thought step \( you need some piece of paper \)  **step 1:** I lost something. **step 2:** I have to look for the lost thing. **step 3:** I'm searching for it. **step 4:** If I found it, I will stop searching              else, I will ask myself "Do I really need it". **step 5:** If my answer is "Yes", I will continue searching for the thing.              else, Stop looking for it  Is it clear? If it is. You have to write your own thought whose represented by flowchart.

**2. Guessing a number flowchart**  
Clear thought step \( you need some piece of paper \)  
  
**step 1:** I want to guess a number from user.  
**step 2:** User has to give me an integer number.  
**step 3:** Starting guess a number by setting up some variables to check  
              F:int, the final answer  
              M:int, a multiply factor  
**step 4:** If my variable equal to user's input then print my variable as an answer and stop program.  
**step 5:** If my variable is not equal to user's input   
              plus one to M variable  
              then do step 3 again.  
  
Is it clear? If it is. You have to write your own thought whose represented by flowchart.

**3. Convert Farenheit degree to Celcius degree**

Clear thought step \( you need some piece of paper \)  
  
**step 1:** User give a temperature value in Fatenheit degree as real number.  
**step 2:** Convert Farenheit degree to Calcius degree with fomula  
              $$C = \dfrac{5}{9}(F-32 )$$   
**step 3:** Print converted value on screen.  
**step 4:** Is user want to convert another temperature.  
             If 'yes', then go back to **step 1.**  
             if 'no', then stop program.  
  
Is it clear? If it is. You have to write your own thought whose represented by flowchart.

**Now you turn to do so, Good Luck!**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Exercises** 

1. Write a flow chart to classify a real number to even or odd number.
2. Write a flow chart to verify two different numbers which A divided by B is integer if A and B are integer and recieve from user respectively
3. Write a flow chart to group students into to 3 groups of 'Fail', 'Pass', and 'Incredible' by GPA 0.00 to 1.50 =&gt; 'Fail' 1.51 to 3.50 =&gt; 'Pass' 3.51 to 4.00 =&gt; 'Incredible'
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Problems**

1. Study a Tic-Tac-Toe game \(aka XO\),  the rules and the game, then write a flow chart to explain how the game working to non-technical reader.
2. Study a Floappy bird and write down a flow chart to descript the game as best as posible.
3. From \(2\) after you did a flow chart, could you suggest user to the best play strategy.
